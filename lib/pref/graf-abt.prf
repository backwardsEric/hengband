# On the Mac, use Angband's version of Adam Bolt's tiles rather than
# Hengband's version.  Besides changes in transparency, Angband's version
# has the following changes relative to Hengband:
#
# Lose 32 columns, i.e. all second coordinates from 0xA0 to 0xBF.
#
# Lose 7 rows, i.e. all first coordinates from 0xBC to 0xC2.
#
# 0x83/0x8C and 0x83/0x90 are completely transparent while the Hengband version
# is completely black but it is not clear whether they were intended to be
# used as background rather than foreground.  Neither are referenced in
# graf-new.prf.
#
# 0x8B/0x9D is empty while Hengband's version has something.
#
# 0x8D/0x98 to 0x8D/0x9E are empty while Hengband's version has something
# there.
#
# 0x8E/0x9C is empty while Hengband's version has something.  It is not
# referenced in graf-new.prf.
#
# 0xA1/0x9D to 0xA1/0x9F are different.  Angband's contents look more like
# the quylthulgs that are assigned to those by graf-new.prf than Hengband's
# contents, so those are not fixed up below.
#
# 0xB4/0x91 to 0xB4/0x9A are empty while Hengband's version has something
# there.  None are referenced in graf-new.prf.
#
# 0xB5/0x9B is empty while Hengband's version has something there.
#
# 0xB6/0x8E is empty while Hengband's version has something.  It is not
# referenced in graf-new.prf.
#
# 0xB6/0x92 and 0xB6/0x93 are different.  
#
# 0xBB/0x82 to 0xBB/0x9F are empty while Hengband's version has something
# there.
