      <P>If you have trouble using the application or suggestions for
        improvement, it would be best to post them to the
        <A HREF="http://angband.oook.cz/forum/showthread.php?t=9554">Hengband OS X thread</A> on the
        <A HREF="http://angband.oook.cz/forum">Angband forums at
        http://angband.oook.cz/forum</A> or on the ticket list at
        <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/">https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/</A>..
      <P>The hope is to have the application run on Mac OS X 10.8 or later.
        The system I have access to runs 10.15 and that's the system where the
        application has been tested.  If you encounter trouble with another
        version of Mac OS X, please post in the Hengband OS X thread.
      <P>If the application fails to run and the system does not provide a
        useful explanation of why it failed, you might try the following:
        <OL>
          <LI>Open a Terminal window, from the Go-&gt;Utilities menu in the
            Finder.
          <LI>In the Terminal run the following, but replace
            <VAR>/Users/somebody/Desktop</VAR> with the location where you
            placed the hengband application:
            <OL>
              <LI><CODE>cd /Users/somebody/Desktop/hengband.app/Contents/MacOS</CODE>
              <LI><CODE>./hengband</CODE>
            </OL>
        </OL>
        <P>Then any messages from the application will appear in the Terminal
        window rather than be buried in the system logs or not reported at all.
