        <LI><A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/downloads/72021/Hengband-2.2.1.7c-English.dmg/">English version; 2.2.1.7c</A>
        <LI><A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/downloads/72021/Hengband-2.2.1.7c-Japanese.dmg/">Japanese version; 2.2.1.7c</A>

      <P>I have put together a version of the rogue-like game,
         <A HREF="https://hengband.osdn.jp/en/">Hengband</A>, for computers
        running Mac OS X 10.8 or later.  To use the English version, download
        <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/downloads/72021/Hengband-2.2.1.7c-English.dmg/">Hengband-2.2.1.7c-English.dmg</A>,
        double click on the downloaded file to open the disk image, and then
        drag the hengband application to where you want to store it.  Double
        clicking on the application will run it.  Since the application has not
        been signed, you'll likely have to make an exception for it to use the
        application.  Follow <A HREF="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac">this link</A> for
        Apple's instructions on how to do that.  In short, one way to grant
        an exception is
        <OL>
          <LI>Control click (i.e. click while holding the control button down)
            on the application in the Finder.
          <LI>Select "Open" in the menu that comes up.
          <LI>That will bring up a confirmation dialog about allowing the
            application to open on the system.
          <LI>If your account does not have administrator privileges, there'll
            be an additional dialog asking you to authenticate as an
            administrator to apply the exception to the security settings.
        </OL>
      <P>A Japanese version is also available.  The installation instructions
        are essentially the same, but you'll need to download <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/downloads/72021/Hengband-2.2.1.7c-Japanese.dmg/">Hengband-2.2.1.7c-Japanese.dmg</A>.
      <P>Both versions correspond to version 2.2.1.7 of Hengband with changes
        to support the Mac OS X interface, a change for how rivers are added
        in dungeons which nominally do not allow any of the river types,
        some corrections for using unidentified items from the pack,
        a correction for a division by zero exception when choosing monsters
        for arena battles, the addition of the monster list update option,
        some changes to the English versions of some game messages,
        and incorporation of Hengband's changes for non-Windows builds since
        the 2.2.1.7 release.
    <H1>Acknowledgements</H1>
      <P>None of this would have been possible without the Hengband source
        code and code, especially for the Mac OS X interface and tile set
        configuration, from
        <A HREF="https://github.com/NickMcConnell/poschengband">poschengband</A> and
        <A HREF="http://rephial.org">Angband</A>.  All of the hard work was
        done by the contributors to those projects.
