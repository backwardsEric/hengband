    <H1>Changes</H1>
      <OL>
        <LI>2.2.1.7f includes the following changes:
        <UL>
          <LI>Include a binary with native support for x86_64 and arm systems.
            I don't have access to an arm-based Mac so it's best to treat
            running natively on an arm-based Mac as an experimental feature.
          <LI>For the Japanese version, fixed regression introduced in 2.2.1.7d:
            incorrect internal sanity check led to some characters not being
            rendered (most obviously in item names in the stores) or to some
            characters not being cleared (seen when switching between screens
            in the character sheet).
          <LI>For the Japanese version, fixed garbled characters for some spells
            in the spell lists.
          <LI>No longer use Angband 4's versions of the graphical tiles.
            Instead used Hengband's versions converted to PNG with transparency
            added.
          <LI>For Japanese, no longer use Osaka as the default font since it
            is not included with macOS Catalina by default.  Instead, use
            Hiragino Maru Gothic ProN.
          <LI>Don't call Term_activate() from drawRect().  That caused crashes
            with Angband on some versions of macOS.
          <LI>Changed how the fallback preferences for the font name and size
            are set so they'll properly influence the configuration for the
            windows.
          <LI>Changed to avoid a compilation error with recent versions of
            Xcode.
          <LI>Allow for the possibility that a rendered character requires
            a surrogate pair when encoded as UTF-16.
          <LI>Fixed regression in the macOS interface:  wasn't considering the
            full GLYPH_COUNT glyphs in updateGlyphInfo().
          <LI>Use VERSION_NAME rather than an explicit "Hengband" in more places
            in the macOS interface.
          <LI>In Term_pict_cocoa(), step through the passed-in arrays in
            increments of the tile width scaling.  Does not matter in the
            current configuration where only one tile at a time is passed to
            Term_pict_cocoa().
          <LI>Made some comment changes and code rearrangements in the macOS
            code so it can be more easily be compared against the code in other
            variants.
          <LI>The executable was compiled on macOS 10.15.7 rather than
            10.15.5.  If you encounter problems with versions of macOS prior
            to 10.15 or with macOS 10.16, please let me know.
        </UL>
        <LI>July 2, 2020.  2.2.1.7e includes the following changes:
        <UL>
          <LI>Fixed bug:  initialize displayed state of the "big tiles" setting
            in the menu from the stored value rather than always setting it to
            true.
          <LI>Configured so the writable game files are put in
            <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband-2.2.1</CODE> rather than
            <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband</CODE>.  You may delete
            <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband</CODE> if you don't want to retain the
            high scores file and previously saved games.  If you want to carry
            over the high scores file or previously saved games you could
            <OL>
              <LI>Rename <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband</CODE> to
                <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband-2.2.1</CODE> prior to running the new
                version.
              <LI>Copy the contents of <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband/apex</CODE> to
                <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband-2.2.1/apex</CODE> and the contents of
                <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband/save</CODE> to
                <CODE>~/Documents/Hengband-2.2.1/save</CODE> after running the
                new version.
            </OL>
          <LI>The executable was compiled on macOS 10.15.5 rather than
            macOS 10.14.6.  If you encounter problems with versions of
            macOS prior to 10.15, please let me know.
          <LI>Made minor changes to English messages:
          <OL>
            <LI>The short description for the Trump realm wasn't cleared
              properly on the birth screen.
            <LI>Changed English diary entries about gender and personality
              selection so "gender" appears in the one for gender and
              "personality" in the one about personality.
            <LI>Changed diary entry about realm selection to put "and" between
              the realms if there are two and to pluralize "realm" as
              appropriate.
            <LI>Corrected typo in a rumor.
            <LI>Dropped period in a knowledge menu item for consistency with
              the rest of the menu.
          </OL>
          <LI>Changed to initialize the effective group ID and effective user
            ID before calling init_angband().  Has no apparent effect with
            Hengband 2.2.1.7 but is necessary for Hengband 1.6.2.
        </UL>
        <LI>March 28, 2020.  2.2.1.7d includes the following changes:
        <UL>
          <LI>Fixed regression:  changing the font or tile set during character
            generation in the macOS front end would cause a crash.
          <LI>For <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/40204">ticket 40204</A>,
            configured terminals other than the main one in the macOS
            front end as non-floating panels so they have narrower title bars.
            Has the side effect that those terminals will automatically hide
            when one switches to another application.
          <LI>For <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/40203">ticket 40203</A>,
            added the dimensions, in rows and columns, to the title bar for
            each terminal window shown in the macOS front end.
          <LI>For <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/40060">ticket 40060</A>,
            changed the kanji for the File menu's "New" entry in the Japanese
            version of the macOS front end.
          <LI>For <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/40202">ticket 40202</A>,
            changed so the prompt to select new or open on the splash screen
            for the macOS front end always has the same position relative
            to the rest of the splash screen text regardless of the dimensions
            of the window.
          <LI>For <A HREF="https://osdn.net/projects/hengbandforosx/ticket/39940">ticket 39940</A>,
            changed English diary entries to consistently use simple past
            tense.  Also omitted the subject in the diary entries when it was
            "you".  Made some changes in the entries to be more idiomatic.
          <LI>For the macOS front end, brought over changes from Angband
            to improve the drawing speed.
          <LI>For the macOS front end, modified so user changes to a
            window's width are in increments of the width of a column and
            user changes to a window's height are in increments of the height
            of a row.
          <LI>For the macOS front end, changed to round down when
            calculating the number of columns for a given size so a font change
            can leave blank space at the end of a row rather than a partially
            obscured character.
          <LI>Changed readme_eng.txt to bring it up to date.
          <LI>Changed some English game messages to fix a typo on the first
            birth screen and improve some the notifications about the player's
            aura damaging monsters.
          <LI>For the Japanese version of the macOS front end, changed the
            copyright string to match the line crediting Mr. Hoge from
            news_j.txt.
        </UL>
        <LI>February 24, 2020.  2.2.1.7c includes the following changes:
        <UL>
          <LI>The new version now requires 10.8 or later since the application
            makes use of "Base localization" for internalionalization.
          <LI>Changed the encoding of the keycode and option modifier in macro
            triggers generated by the Cocoa interface in response to
            keypresses.  Removed direct mapping of some keys (cursor keys, help
            function key, and delete function key) to the underlying command
            set and instead pass those through the macro trigger mechanism.
            Those changes allow the cursor keys to work in the editor for the
	    autopick settings and allow more modifiers (like shift for running)
	    to work with the numeric keypad.  Added trigger names to match the
	    macro triggers generated by the Cocoa interface in pref-mac.prf.
	    If you had set up custom macro triggers based on the old encoding
	    of the keycode, those will have to be redone.
          <LI>Corrected regression that caused the main window's minimum size
            to not be correctly set at startup.
          <LI>The response to font changes in the main window does a better
            job of keeping the player in the bounds of the window.
          <LI>Corrected handling of full screen mode:  exiting while in
            fullscreen mode no longer leaves the main window acting as if it
            was still in fullscreen mode when the application is restarted.
          <LI>Keep the save and command menu items disabled during character
            generation since they aren't useful until the character enters
            the world.  Also keep the save menu entry disabled while on the
            splash screen.
          <LI>Made some additional English message changes including a
            correction for the message about a weaponsmith adding an essence to
            an item and more English descriptions of artifacts that were
            missing descriptions.
          <LI>Merged in upstream's changes for building on non-Windows
            platforms, including the new --with-varpath=PATH option to
            configure.
          <LI>For developing the application, made it easier to change the
            user interface with Xcode's Interface Builder.
          <LI>Tile set rendering changes:
          <UL>
            <LI>Since use Angband's version of the tile sets on the Mac, added
              workarounds in the preference files for the cases where those
              tile sets differ from Hengband's versions.  Especially for
              terrain, that makes tiles more useful in the Mac version.
            <LI>Added support for big tile mode in the Mac interface.  It is
              enabled by default and can be turned on or off from the Settings
              menu.
            <LI>Corrected regression that objects and creatures were always
              shown with a black background.
            <LI>Changed to better handle if an error occurs while loading or
              converting the tile set image.
            <LI>Changed so that blending is used if the tile set has an
              alpha channel.
            <LI>As an optimization, don't draw the foreground if it is the
              same as the background.
          </UL>
        </UL>
        <LI>December 31, 2019.  Plugged memory leak in autopick_autoregister().
          Changed init_saved_floors() to only check for out-of-date saved
          floors if savefile is not an empty string; that prevents spurious
          messages about old temporary files when "New" is selected in the
          Cocoa front-end for macOS.  Redid earlier change for English
          message crashes in spell_RF6_HEAL() to be more compact.  Made many
          adjustments to the text of English messages especially in monster and
          item descriptions.  To better match the source material, the base
          object for the crown of Amber is now a Jewel Encrusted Crown rather
          than a Golden Crown.
        <LI>December 1, 2019.  Changed Cocoa rendering so text is rendered
          more compactly and to avoid deprecated
          CGContextShowGlyphsWithAdvances.
        <LI>November 12, 2019.  Ported upstream's correction for a
          division by zero exception when choosing monsters for arena battles.
          Corrected English spelling mistakes in the Hunter's office and one
          ability description.  Changed the English description of the ranger
          class.
        <LI>October 24, 2019.  Added upstream's modification for the update
          monster list option.  Made several changes to English messages,
          primarily for character generation, the in-game help, and
          explanations in the autopick editor. 
        <LI>October 2, 2019.  Changed to use upstream's fix for rivers in
          dungeons:  levels in Yeek's den can have rivers of water.  Changed
          to avoid crash in English version if "Merfolk" is selected as the
          race.  Changed to avoid crash if "Auto" selected when destroying an
          item and neither autopick preference file is present.  For English,
          adjusted layout in character screen so the row for sustains
          experience aligns with the others.  Made many adjustments, primarily
          for spell and ability descriptions or messages, to English game
          messages.  For the macOS interface, changed to disable "Window"
          menu entries until the backend is ready.  That prevents crashes if
          the item is selected before a character is selected.  Also changed
          to recompute the minimum window size after changing the font and to
          coerce the current window size at least as large as the minimum size
          if necessary.
        <LI>September 16, 2019.  Changed floor-generate.c to avoid patches
          of unidentified terrain and crashes in dungeons like Yeek's den.
          Changes spells2.c to avoid an uninitialized variable and potential
          crash in one branch of probing().  Changed cmd-smith.c to correct a
          misleading English message about enhancing multiple items.  For the
          English version, modified monster1.c to avoid missing output in
          monster recall and compiler warnings about unused expressions.
          Made several changes for grammar or clarity in English messages.
          Changed a cast in files.c to avoid a compiler warning.  For the
          macOS interface, changed the names for the terminal windows in
          the Window menu to match the names in the windows' title bars.
          Localized Info.plist for Japanese and changed the Japanese version
          of the menus to use 変愚蛮怒 instead of hengband.  Adjusted some
          of the automake files to carry over more files when "make dist" is
          run.  Changed the handling of Objective C in configure.ac for better
          portability.  Also reduced the number of library dependencies for the
          Cocoa version.
        <LI>September 10, 2019.  Corrected two more English game messages that
          could cause crashes (from spell_RF6_HASTE() and spell_RF6_HEAL() in
          mspells4.c).  Changed so that eating an unidentified item from the
          pack or reading an unidentified scroll from the pack would not have
          the potential to remove a different item from the pack.  Changed so
          that aiming an unidentified wand from the pack or using an
          unidentified staff from the pack would not have the potential to
          remove a charge from a different item.  Corrected some typos in the
          English version ("less" in some messages increasing a statistic;
          duplicated character level in monster recall; some corrections in
          the rumors).  In the English version, made minor layout adjustments
          for the level indicator in the main screen, page indicator in the
          shops, and for the digging and infravision proficiencies in the
          character screen.  For the macOS interface, changed the rendering
          to reduce the clearing and clipping artifacts with fonts like Snell
          Roundhand and Zapfino.  That will change the number of rows and
          columns that can be displayed in a given space with most fonts so
          you'll likely have to adjust your window layout.  Added a
          bigcurs_hook implementation so that the cursor over a kanji
          character in the Japanese version will encompass the character.
        <LI>August 29, 2019.  Corrected three English game messages that could
          could cause crashes (from castle_quest() in bldg.c,
          spell_RF6_HEAL() in mspells4.c, and project_m() in spells1.c).
          Replaced more instances of "current_world_ptr-&gt;game_turn" with
          "turn" in English messages.  Changed macOS interface to avoid
          clearing artifacts along the tops of characters when using the
          Rockwell or DIN Condensed fonts.  That change will mean less rows
          for a given terminal height with some fonts.  There still are
          clearing artifacts on the right side of "@" with the Snell Roundhand
          and Zapfino fonts.
        <LI>August 27, 2019.  Initial release
