        <LI>August 27, 2019.  Initial release
        <LI>August 29, 2019.  Corrected three English game messages that could
          could cause crashes (from castle_quest() in bldg.c,
          spell_RF6_HEAL() in mspells4.c, and project_m() in spells1.c).
          Replaced more instances of "current_world_ptr-&gt;game_turn" with
          "turn" in English messages.  Changed Mac OS X interface to avoid
          clearing artifacts along the tops of characters when using the
          Rockwell or DIN Condensed fonts.  That change will mean less rows
          for a given terminal height with some fonts.  There still are
          clearing artifacts on the right side of "@" with the Snell Roundhand
          and Zapfino fonts.
        <LI>September 10, 2019.  Corrected two more English game messages that
          could cause crashes (from spell_RF6_HASTE() and spell_RF6_HEAL() in
          mspells4.c).  Changed so that eating an unidentified item from the
          pack or reading an unidentified scroll from the pack would not have
          the potential to remove a different item from the pack.  Changed so
          that aiming an unidentified wand from the pack or using an
          unidentified staff from the pack would not have the potential to
          remove a charge from a different item.  Corrected some typos in the
          English version ("less" in some messages increasing a statistic;
          duplicated character level in monster recall; some corrections in
          the rumors).  In the English version, made minor layout adjustments
          for the level indicator in the main screen, page indicator in the
          shops, and for the digging and infravision proficiencies in the
          character screen.  For the Mac OS X interface, changed the rendering
          to reduce the clearing and clipping artifacts with fonts like Snell
          Roundhand and Zapfino.  That will change the number of rows and
          columns that can be displayed in a given space with most fonts so
          you'll likely have to adjust your window layout.  Added a
          bigcurs_hook implementation so that the cursor over a kanji
          character in the Japanese version will encompass the character.
        <LI>September 16, 2019.  Changed floor-generate.c to avoid patches
          of unidentified terrain and crashes in dungeons like Yeek's den.
          Changes spells2.c to avoid an uninitialized variable and potential
          crash in one branch of probing().  Changed cmd-smith.c to correct a
          misleading English message about enhancing multiple items.  For the
          English version, modified monster1.c to avoid missing output in
          monster recall and compiler warnings about unused expressions.
          Made several changes for grammar or clarity in English messages.
          Changed a cast in files.c to avoid a compiler warning.  For the
          Mac OS X interface, changed the names for the terminal windows in
          the Window menu to match the names in the windows' title bars.
          Localized Info.plist for Japanese and changed the Japanese version
          of the menus to use 変愚蛮怒 instead of hengband.  Adjusted some
          of the automake files to carry over more files when "make dist" is
          run.  Changed the handling of Objective C in configure.ac for better
          portability.  Also reduced the number of library dependencies for the
          Cocoa version.
        <LI>October 2, 2019.  Changed to use upstream's fix for rivers in
          dungeons:  levels in Yeek's den can have rivers of water.  Changed
          to avoid crash in English version if "Merfolk" is selected as the
          race.  Changed to avoid crash if "Auto" selected when destroying an
          item and neither autopick preference file is present.  For English,
          adjusted layout in character screen so the row for sustains
          experience aligns with the others.  Made many adjustments, primarily
          for spell and ability descriptions or messages, to English game
          messages.  For the Mac OS X interface, changed to disable "Window"
          menu entries until the backend is ready.  That prevents crashes if
          the item is selected before a character is selected.  Also changed
          to recompute the minimum window size after changing the font and to
          coerce the current window size at least as large as the minimum size
          if necessary.
        <LI>October 24, 2019.  Added upstream's modification for the update
          monster list option.  Made several changes to English messages,
          primarily for character generation, the in-game help, and
          explanations in the autopick editor. 
        <LI>November 12, 2019.  Ported upstream's correction for a
          division by zero exception when choosing monsters for arena battles.
          Corrected English spelling mistakes in the Hunter's office and one
          ability description.  Changed the English description of the ranger
          class.
        <LI>December 1, 2019.  Changed Cocoa rendering so text is rendered
          more compactly and to avoid deprecated
          CGContextShowGlyphsWithAdvances.
