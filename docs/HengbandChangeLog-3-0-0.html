        <LI>January 22, 2024.  3.0.1 Beta6 incoroporates all of the changes in
          Hengband's preliminary 3.0.0 versions up to 3.0.1Beta6.  You can
          find Hengband's notes, in Japanese, on what has changed at
          <A HREF="https://hengband.github.io/history.html">https://hengband.github.io/history.html</A>.  The changes that are specific to the Mac interface

          <UL>
            <LI>In the readme, update the minimum OS version needed for
              compiling.
            <LI>Link to THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt in the about dialog.
            <LI>An upstream change avoids the game from exiting during
              startup on versions of macOS 14 as the game processes
              MonsterRaceDefinitions.txt.
            <LI>Work around which std::span constructors are available with
              clang 14.
            <LI>Fall back to AC_CHECK_LIB if PKG_CHECK_MODULES does not find
              libcurl.
            <LI>Port over Vanilla Angband's file_open_hook so double clicking
              on save files generated by this version works.  Resolves
              <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues/20">https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues/20</A>.
            <LI>Adapt to upstream's changes to the subwindow flags.
            <LI>Install lib/file/books into the application bundle.
            <LI>Avoid deprecation warnings for targeting macOS 10.15.
            <LI>Adapt to upstream's changes to path_build() and savefile.
            <LI>This release was build on macOS 12.7.2.  There are no changes
              to the minimum required version of macOS (still 10.15).
          </UL>
        <LI>May 4, 2023.  3.0.0 Alpha81 incorporates all of the changes in
          Hengband's preliminary 3.0.0 versions up to 3.0.0Alpha81.  You can
          find Hengband's notes, in Japanese, on what has changed at
          <A HREF="https://hengband.github.io/history.html">https://hengband.github.io/history.html</A>.  The changes that are specific to the Mac interface
          or this fork are:
          <UL>
            <LI>For the Mac frontend, implement the option for background
              music like the Window frontend has.  As part of that, rearranges
              how all sounds are handled.  The volume of incidental sounds that
              aren't the system alert sound can be configured.  The use of the
              system alert sound will be turned off when incidental sounds are
              turned off.
            <LI>For the Mac frontend, disable sending commands from the command
              menu and changing the tile set or wide tile mode when in an
              in-game menu.
            <LI>For the Mac frontend, better center the splash screen.
            <LI>For the Mac frontend, change some Japanese labels in the menus.
              Resolves <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues/30">https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues/30</A>.
            <LI>For the Mac frontend, cover F17 to F19 in pref-mac.prf.
              Resolves <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues/25">https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues/25</A>.
            <LI>For the Mac front end, add paranoia about a big cursor
              extending beyond a terminal's bounds.
            <LI>Fix handling of the PRIVATE_USER_PATH case in
              create_needed_dirs().
            <LI>This release now requires macOS 10.15 or later rather than
              10.13 or later.  It was built on macOS 12.6.5.
          </UL>
        <LI>September 19, 2022.  3.0.0 Alpha67 incorporates all of the changes
          in Hengband's preliminary 3.0.0 versions up to 3.0.0Alpha67.  You
          can find Hengband's notes, in Japanese, on what has changed at
          <A HREF="https://hengband.github.io/history.html">https://hengband.github.io/history.html</A>.
          The Mac interface is essentially that of the 2.2.1.7g or 2.2.1.7h
          releases with adaptations to work with the 3.0.0 code base.  It does
          use a different directory, ~/Documents/Hengband-3.0.0, for storing
          save files, character dumps and other game data.  It also requires a
          more recent version of macOS, 10.13.  The executable was compiled on
          macOS 12.5.1.
        <LI>February 7, 2022.  3.0.0 Alpha52 incorporates all of the changes
          in Hengband's preliminary 3.0.0 versions up to 3.0.0Alpha52.  The Mac
          interface is essentially that of the 2.2.1.7g release with adaptations
          to work with the 3.0.0 code base.  It does use a different directory,
          ~/Documents/Hengband-3.0.0, than 2.2.1.7g for storing save files,
          character dumps, and other game data.  It also requires a more recent
          version of macOS, 10.13.  The executable was compiled on macOS 11.6.2.
