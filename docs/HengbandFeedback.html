      <P>If you have trouble using the application or suggestions for
        improvement, it would be best to post them to the
        <A HREF="http://angband.oook.cz/forum/showthread.php?t=9554">Hengband OS X thread</A> on the
        <A HREF="http://angband.oook.cz/forum">Angband forums at
        http://angband.oook.cz/forum</A> or on the ticket list at
        <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues">https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/issues</A>.
      <P>The hope is to have the application run on macOS 10.8 (10.15 for
        the versions based on Hengband 3.0.0) or later.  The system I have
        access to runs 12.7.5, and that is the system where the application has
        been tested.  If you encounter trouble with another version of macOS,
        please post in the Hengband OS X thread.
      <P>If the application fails to run and the system does not provide a
        useful explanation of why it failed, you might try the following:
        <OL>
          <LI>Open a Terminal window, from the Go-&gt;Utilities menu in the
            Finder.
          <LI>In the Terminal run the following, but replace
            <VAR>/Users/somebody/Desktop</VAR> with the location where you
            placed the hengband application:
            <OL>
              <LI><CODE>cd /Users/somebody/Desktop/hengband.app/Contents/MacOS</CODE>
              <LI><CODE>./hengband</CODE>
            </OL>
        </OL>
        <P>Then any messages from the application will appear in the Terminal
        window rather than be buried in the system logs or not reported at all.
