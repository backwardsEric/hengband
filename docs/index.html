    <H1>Instructions</H1>
      <P>I have put together a version of the rogue-like game,
        <A HREF="https://hengband.github.io">Hengband</A>, for computers
        running macOS 10.8 (the versions based on Hengband 3.0.0 require 10.13)
        or later.  To use the English version, download one of
        <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/releases/download/vmacos3.0.0-alpha66/Hengband-3.0.0-Alpha67-English.dmg">Hengband-3.0.0-Alpha67-English.dmg</A>,
        <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/releases/download/vmacos2.2.1-7h/Hengband-2.2.1.7h-English.dmg/">Hengband-2.2.1.7h-English.dmg</A>,
        or <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/releases/download/vmacos1.6.2-d/Hengband-1.6.2d-English.dmg/">Hengband-1.6.2d-English.dmg</A>.
        The first is based on Hengband's current development branch.  The second
        is based on Hengband's development branch from 2019.  The last is
        based on Hengband's last stable release.  Double click on the
        downloaded file to open the disk image, and then drag the hengband
        application to where you want to store it.  Double clicking on the
        application will run it.  Since the application has not been signed,
        you'll likely have to make an exception for it to use the
        application.  Follow <A HREF="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac">this link</A> for
        Apple's instructions on how to do that.  In short, one way to grant an
        exception is
        <OL>
          <LI>Control click (i.e. click while holding the control button down)
            on the application in the Finder.
          <LI>Select "Open" in the menu that comes up.
          <LI>That will bring up a confirmation dialog about allowing the
            application to open on the system.
          <LI>If your account does not have administrator privileges, there'll
            be an additional dialog asking you to authenticate as an
            administrator to apply the exception to the security settings.
        </OL>
      <P>A Japanese version is also available.  The installation instructions
        are essentially the same, but you'll need to download
        <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/releases/download/vmacos3.0.0-alpha66/Hengband-3.0.0-Alpha67-Japanese.dmg">Hengband-3.0.0-Alpha67-Japanese.dmg</A>,
        <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/releases/download/vmacos2.2.1-7h/Hengband-2.2.1.7h-Japanese.dmg">Hengband-2.2.1.7h-Japanese.dmg</A>, or
        <A HREF="https://github.com/backwardsEric/hengband/releases/download/vmacos1.6.2-d/Hengband-1.6.2d-Japanese.dmg">Hengband-1.6.2d-Japanese.dmg</A>.
      <P>The versions based on the preliminary releases of Hengband 3.0.0
        use Hengband's current development branch as a basis and add support
        for a macOS interface using Cocoa.
      <P>The versions based on Hengband 2.2.1.7 started with master branch
        source code as of April 10th, 2019 and added these changes:

          <LI>Support for the macOS interface using Cocoa

      <P>The versions based on Hengband 1.6.2 started with the source code

            February 2020 patch from the master branch

          <LI>Extended internal buffer to avoid overflow in English entry
            about the player's death (already made in master branch)
          <LI>Avoid compiler warnings about 32-bit integers passed to long
            integer format specifiers by adding casts, changing the format
            specifier, or changing the type of a local variable
          <LI>Avoid 32-bit integers passed to long integer format specifiers
            for msg_format() and format() by adding casts
          <LI>Replace instances of fprintf(fd, s) with fputs(s, fd) as has
            been done on the master branch
          <LI>Update the inventory window after eating a wand
          <LI>A curses compatibility change made on August 12, 2011 in the
            master branch
          <LI>Changes for compatibility with modern versions of autoconf
            and automake
        </UL>
    <H1>Acknowledgements</H1>
      <P>None of this would have been possible without the Hengband source
        code and code, especially for the macOS interface and tile set
        configuration, from
        <A HREF="https://github.com/NickMcConnell/poschengband">poschengband</A> and
        <A HREF="http://rephial.org">Angband</A>.  All of the hard work was
        done by the contributors to those projects.
